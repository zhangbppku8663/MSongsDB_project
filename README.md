# MSongsDB_project
A project initialization for analyzing Million Songs DB

The Million Song Dataset is a freely-available collection of audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks. In the early phase of this project, a subset (1.8GB) of the full dataset (280 GB) has been used to test codes.
The goals of this project are to:
1. analyse correlations among basic song track information including duration, tempo, loudness, hotttnesss, familiarity etc. and audio segmentation information.
2. build a machine learning model to predict sound track hotttnesss based on track metadata
3. apply the procedure on the full dataset
